                                <p> The eastern box turtle, North Carolinaâ€™s state reptile, is in decline across the state. As of 2011, the IUCN has classified eastern box turtles as a vulnerable species (i.e. likely to become endangered unless circumstances are improved). We need your help to find, photograph and monitor eastern box turtles in or near neighborhoods, your place of work, and other areas!
                                    Piedmont Wildlife Center, AI expert Jonathan D'Souza, his sons Jack and Noah in web development, and WildTrack are collaborating to analyze these photos and identify individuals for non-invasive monitoring of box turtles throughout the NC Triangle region and beyond.</p>
